# HackRice 2021 - Educhemical: A HydroCarbon structure generator

The main objective of the project is to develop an efficient algorithm to generate a graphic structure of a hydrocarbon from its IUPAC name implementing various data structures. We aim to provide a simple and easy to use platform for users to obtain structures of straight chain hydrocarbons in just 1 click! Users can benefit by understanding basic concepts like systematic nomenclature of organic compounds and visualizing molecular compounds for a better learning experience. It is also an offline application, i.e. can work without an internet connection.

The code is written to run on Turbo C++ IDE.
Running on any other IDE will not generate required graphics used in this application!!
